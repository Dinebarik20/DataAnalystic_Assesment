 Account Inactivity Alert

Scenario: The ops team wants to flag accounts with no inflow transactions for over one year.
Task: Find all active accounts (savings or investments) with no transactions in the last 1 year (365 days) .
Tables:
plans_plan
savings_savingsaccount


ANSWER:


WITH transactions_last_year AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id
    FROM 
        savings_savingsaccount
    WHERE 
        transaction_time >= DATEADD(day, -365, GETDATE())
    UNION
    SELECT 
        user_id
    FROM 
        plans_plan
    WHERE 
        transaction_time >= DATEADD(day, -365, GETDATE())
)
SELECT 
    u.id, 
    u.name 
FROM 
    users_customuser u
WHERE 
    u.is_active = 1
    AND u.id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM transactions_last_year);


EXPLANATION

1. transactions_last_year CTE: Gathers the user IDs of all transactions that occurred within the past year from both savings_savingsaccount and plans_plan tables.

2. Final SELECT: Fetches all active (is_active = 1) user accounts from the users_customuser table, excluding those found in the transactions_last_year CTE.
