 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

Scenario: Marketing wants to estimate CLV based on account tenure and transaction volume (simplified model).

Task: For each customer, assuming the profit_per_transaction is 0.1% of the transaction value, calculate:
Account tenure (months since signup)
Total transactions
Estimated CLV (Assume: CLV = (total_transactions / tenure) * 12 * avg_profit_per_transaction)
Order by estimated CLV from highest to lowest


ANSWER:

WITH transaction_summary AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_transactions,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, MIN(register_date), CURRENT_DATE) AS tenure_months
    FROM 
        savings_savingsaccount
    GROUP BY 
        user_id
), clv_estimates AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        total_transactions,
        tenure_months,
        (total_transactions / tenure_months) * 12 * 0.001 AS estimated_clv
    FROM 
        transaction_summary
)
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    c.estimated_clv
FROM 
    users_customuser u
JOIN 
    clv_estimates c ON u.id = c.user_id
WHERE 
    u.is_active = 1
ORDER BY 
    c.estimated_clv DESC;



EXPLANATION

1. transaction_summary CTE: i use  common table expression calculates the total transaction amount and the account tenure in months for each user.

2. clv_estimates CTE: i use this to calculates the estimated CLV using the formula provided: ((total_transactions / tenure_months) * 12 * 0.001).

3. Final SELECT: and  selects the user ID, name, and estimated CLV from the users_customuser table, filtering to only include active users, and sorting the results by estimated CLV in descending order
