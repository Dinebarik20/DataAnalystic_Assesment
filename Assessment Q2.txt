Transaction Frequency Analysis

Scenario: The finance team wants to analyze how often customers transact to segment them (e.g., frequent vs. occasional users).

Task: Calculate the average number of transactions per customer per month and categorize them:
"High Frequency" (=10 transactions/month)
"Medium Frequency" (3-9 transactions/month)
"Low Frequency" (=2 transactions/month)
Tables:
users_customuser
savings_savingsaccount


 ANSWER:


 WITH monthly_transactions AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_time) AS month,
        COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
    FROM 
        savings_savingsaccount
    GROUP BY 
        user_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_time)
), average_transactions AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        AVG(transaction_count) AS avg_monthly_transactions
    FROM 
        monthly_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        user_id
)
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    a.avg_monthly_transactions,
    CASE 
        WHEN a.avg_monthly_transactions >= 10 THEN 'High Frequency'
        WHEN a.avg_monthly_transactions BETWEEN 3 AND 9 THEN 'Medium Frequency'
        ELSE 'Low Frequency'
    END AS frequency_category
FROM 
    average_transactions a
JOIN 
    users_customuser u ON a.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY 
    a.avg_monthly_transactions DESC;


        EXPLANATION.

1.  monthly_transactions CTE: I Calculates the number of transactions for each customer per month.

2.  average_transactions CTE: I Computes the average number of transactions per month for each customer.

2.  SELECT: And i retrieves customer ID, name, average monthly transactions, and classifies them into "High Frequency," "Medium Frequency," and "Low Frequency" based on their average monthly transactions
