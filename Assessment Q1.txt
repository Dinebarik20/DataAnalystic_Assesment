QUESTIONS

1. High-Value Customers with Multiple Products
Scenario: The business wants to identify customers who have both a savings and an investment plan (cross-selling opportunity).
Task: Write a query to find customers with at least one funded savings plan AND one funded investment plan, sorted by total deposits.
Tables:
users_customuser
savings_savingsaccount
plans_plan


Answer:

SELECT
    c.customer_id, 
    c.customer_name, 
    SUM(s.deposit_amount + i.deposit_amount) AS total_deposit
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    savings_plans s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id AND s.status = 'funded'
JOIN 
    investment_plans i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id AND i.status = 'funded'
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.plan_id) > 0 AND COUNT(DISTINCT i.plan_id) > 0
ORDER BY 
    total_deposit DESC;

                              Explanation:

JOINs: I use JOIN to connect the customers, savings_plans, and investment_plans tables based on customer_id.

Conditions: I have to filter the rows where both savings_plans and investment_plans have a status of 'funded'.

SUM: i  calculate the total deposit for each customer by summing up the deposits from both savings_plans and investment_plans.

GROUP BY: i group the results by customer_id and customer_name.

HAVING: We ensure that each customer has at least one funded plan in both savings_plans and investment_plans.

ORDER BY: We sort the results by total_deposit in descending order.
